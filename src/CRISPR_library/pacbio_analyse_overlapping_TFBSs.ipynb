    "Alleles_frequency_table.zip can be unzipped to a tab-separated text file that shows all reads and alignments to references. The first column shows the aligned sequence of the sequenced read. The second column shows the aligned sequence of the reference sequence. Gaps in each of these columns represent insertions and deletions. The next column 'Reference_Name' shows the name of the reference that the read aligned to. The fourth column, 'Read_Status' shows whether the read was modified or unmodified. The fifth through seventh columns ('n_deleted', 'n_inserted', 'n_substituted') show the number of bases deleted, inserted, and substituted as compared to the reference sequence. The eighth column shows the number of reads having that sequence, and the ninth column shows the percentage of all reads having that sequence."
